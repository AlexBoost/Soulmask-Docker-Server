## Requirements

	You'll need to have a docker account install on your machine. either windows or linux. but docker need to be able to execute linux containers.

	>> I'll extends this section later.

## Getting Started

	1. Create a folder for your game (Ex : SoulMaskServer)
	2. Place the file docker-compose.yaml inside it.
	3. Modify property of the docker-compose.yaml to be convenient with your needs.
	4. Execute docker compose => `docker compose up -d` (-d is the option to detach directly from the container)
	5. if you didn't add the -d option, then your server is started, but you're attached to it. You'll have to detached from it.
